# twb-to-yt-timestamp

Converts [tunawithbacon](http://tunawithbacon.com/)-formatted csv files to timestamps
for YouTube video descriptions.

## How to use

Download the release exe from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/hugh-braico/twb-to-yt-timestamp/releases/), 
then click-and-drag TWB-formatted csv files onto it. The output will automatically be
copied to your clipboard.

It will also add some Skullgirls Oceania stuff, since that's what I use it for, but 
you can just remove that stuff (or make your own build that doesn't have that stuff)
